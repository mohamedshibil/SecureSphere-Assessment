# Vulnerability Management for SecureSphere Inc.

### Fictional Company: 
SecureSphere Inc.

### Industry: 
Small e-commerce business

### Scenario: 
SecureSphere Inc. recently launched an online store selling tech gadgets. They operate a simple IT infrastructure with a web server and a workstation, both hosted on virtual machines. After a competitor suffered a data breach due to unpatched vulnerabilities, SecureSphere’s CEO wants to ensure their systems are secure. They’ve "hired" you as a cybersecurity consultant to perform a vulnerability assessment and remediation project using Qualys Vulnerability Scanner and report on the findings.

### Assets:
A vulnerable web server VM (e.g., Metasploitable 2, a lightweight, intentionally vulnerable Linux distro).
A Windows XP or Windows 7 VM (lightweight, vulnerable OS for a workstation).
Nessus Essentials running on your host or a lightweight Linux VM (e.g., Ubuntu Minimal).

### Goal: 
Identify vulnerabilities, prioritize them, remediate critical issues, and document the process for SecureSphere Inc.

### Tools:
Nessus Essentials (free, up to 16 IPs, downloadable from Tenable’s website).
VMware Workstation Player or VirtualBox (free virtualization software).
Vulnerable VMs: Metasploitable 2 (Linux) and an old Windows ISO (e.g., XP or 7, legally obtainable or pre-built from a trusted source like a cybersecurity lab repo).
